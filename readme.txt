* Track responses to specific prompts
* Analyze AI behavior patterns
* Export data for reporting and analysis
* Test different AI models and compare results

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the OpenRouter API to send prompts to various AI models and retrieve responses. This service is required for the core functionality of monitoring LLM responses.

**What data is sent and when:**
- Your configured prompts are sent to OpenRouter each time the cron job runs (daily/weekly) or when you click "Run Now"
- The selected model identifier (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini) is sent with each request
- Your WordPress site URL is sent as the HTTP referer for API tracking

**Service provider:** OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai)
- Terms of Service: https://openrouter.ai/terms
- Privacy Policy: https://openrouter.ai/privacy

**Note:** The plugin also includes a stub model (openrouter/stub-model-v1) for testing that does not make external API calls.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/llm-visibility-monitor` directory, or install through WordPress admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings â†’ LLM Visibility Monitor to configure your OpenRouter API key and prompts
